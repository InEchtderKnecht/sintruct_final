                <p>Last summer, we invited you for the first time to gather at Unsere liebe Frau im Walde in the mountains of South Tyrol, to put our daring project “Sinstruct” into action. With the help of many volunteers, creative artists from various fields and lots of open minded visitors, the festival became a magical happening, composed of both auditive and visual impressions: electronic tones, acoustic jam sessions, human as well as bird vocals, views of green forests and meadows infront of snow capped mountains, an endlessly long seeming, twisting cave, a starlit sky at night, dynamics like a skinny man unrelentingly digging a hole into loamy ground, a dancing paddling pool among a dancing crowd, self tinkered kites climbing the air, ...</p><p>Thanks to the community, the exchange and the collective experience of art in a beautiful and open scenery, Sinstruct became an event, that will happen again in August 2013.<br><br>

                </h2>
                <p>SINSTRUCT. Festi Val di Non Sens. Ein Festival der Art art. aims to give young artists the possibility to come together, communicate and present their art to an open minded audience. Sinstruct unites diverse cultural backgrounds with music, visual arts, video, poetry and other forms of artistic expressions.</p><p>Here the special interest consists in exchanging ideas and crossing boarders: On the one hand divided art categories shall be animated to interact and interfuse. On the other hand the visitors shall be encouraged to step out of their passive role in order to become an active, participating influence to the artistic happening. Furthermore we want to create an artistic platform without the constraints of contact based selection and participation. It is all about quality and sustainability of expression and the playful dialogue between nature and art.</p><p>‘Sinstruct’ is meant as the opposite of ‘construct’ and therefore literally denotes “without structure”. As a concept it doesn’t only look for negation by trying to break with existing structures, but also questions the sense and the function of those structures.</p><p>This very generally framed thought obtains concretion for the festival by relating it to art: In which structures art is embedded and which are its functions in this connection? Is art able / should art / does art want to free itself from these structures? Which structure is required to let art appear as art? How does art structure itself?</p><p>From these exemplary questions, our intentions to place art into nature and to explore the relation between artist and recipient, as well as the relations between the different artistic fields among each other, derive.</p>

                <img src="img/foyt_place.png" class="foyt">
                <p>The festival takes place in Val di Non, close to the little community Unsere liebe Frau im Walde, South Tyrol. Since german and italian speaking territories converge here, it is an intercultural space. The Festival site consists of several areas and spots where installations, concerts, performances and visual exhibitions will take place. Everything happens at the altitude of 1500m between mystic woods and flowery meadows, in the middle of forest glades, an abandoned cave, a bunker and a tunnel gallery under the ground. Some spots are hidden and challenging to discover, others are used for singular happenings on the side of paths as well as on treetops or mountain peaks. Altogether, the festival will be a voyage through nature and culture, artfully put together with tactfulness and sense of localitiy. This kind of respect for the surrounding area, nature and its inhabitants we also expect from every visitor and participant who stays with us in this tiny, common universe we will create alltogether.</p>

                <h2><span>this years topic</span></h2>
                <p>In order to have a thread running through the program, every year a theme will be developed, which, due to its openness, allows multiple perspectives and approaches.</p><p>
                2013 we are moved by “MOTION”. Everything non-stationary moves. Physically, motion is defined as a solid, changing its place relative to time, within a frame of reference. Abstracting space, motion can alter to emotion.
Socially, a group of people, that actively strives for a shift or purpose is called a movement.
Vivid organisms move on their own terms.
Even though or precisely because art naturally contains motion too, it is worth reflecting about the relation between each other. Film, dance and theatre obviously include motion as well as music does. As a course of motions it is deriving from melodies, sequencens one after another which in its origins are nothing else than moving air.</p><p>
                Alike the artwork’s intrsinsic movement, the movement of the beholder matters:
Change of perspective leads to change of the artwork itself. Constantly shifting, due to varying contextualisation, there’s also movement on a higher level of abstraction.
This particular layer especially effects written art or typography. Last but not least a sculpture’s plasticity can only be perceived by a moving observer.</p>

                    Brailleway and Christian Marchi met in 2011. They are sharing their personal research paths throughthe encounter of two different actions, two practices – the sound and the picture. During this researchprocess common issues are resounding. Questions about space, time and the origin.<br><br>

                    After several years spent in the field of instrumental music studying drum, charmed by the research of sounds and animated by the desire of fascinating the dance floor with his music, he starts approaching to this new horizon. His never ending research brings him to explore every field of music and so he can create his own and personal style through the years. He produces combining all the elements of his musical background with a deep-house stuff giving life to a new and original concept. Bound to his drummer roots he approaches crowd with groovy live sets made up by using his drum machines and synths that move people from smooth and mellow sounds to harder ones and as he tells you a story, he takes you on a never felt before journey.<br><br>

                    <span>Circuit Diagram<span>Music</span></span>
Hamburg-based duo Circuit Diagram brings you a harmonious mix of krautrock, post-rock and loose-limbed techno, with touches of Cobblestone Jazz to boot. A winning mix of "cellphone from sahara"-like chant with swinging, organic rhythms and sweeter modular synth curves progressing with the vision of a classic Villalobos, but sounding more like Can gone to modern day Africa.<br><br>

                    In my work shamanism meets post-post-modernity and integral philosophy. I am a dancer, a peace-activist, and spiritual healer. I am on a shamanic initiation-path guided by a Navajo-Medicine-Man. I also went through a school for healing-arts and I studied Peace Studies and Conflict Transformation at the University of Innsbruck/Austria (Master - UNESCO-Chair)<br><br>


Life is transformation. Life is a constant dance and it never stops. We dance our energy and we become this energy, we dance a tree and we become the tree, we dance a picture and we are the picture, we dance love and we are love. In my Butoh-workshops we develop authenticity and sensibility of what happens inside ourself. We dance what we discover and we transform it into free movement, into free energy. We dance our unique and intimate energy by giving it form and direction. Its magic and so we are magic.<br><br>

                    A fancy field trip with soundscaper duo KNRRZ? Meet KNRRZ in the morning for field recording excursion.
In the afternoon, all recordings will be transferred to laptop computers and edited/manipulated with Ableton Live in order to create an improvised soundscape. Participants can contribute to an open session at any time, as they wish. All instruments are allowed.
The artists are available for questions all day and will provide some theoretical knowledge about musique concrète and improvisation.

                    On+Brr aka the Russian and the Bee Master duo. Philipp Meier`s locomotive,
raw synthie-sounds and drum loops unite with Rodion Levin's basso-heavy Perestroika Canto.The Bee Master conducts his buzzing tones through the airwaves beyond space
and back to an occidental atmosphere, while the Russian with his absurd poetry
and idiosyncratic word choice declutters German grammar. Together they create a superbly apolkalyptical DaDa-Noise-Opera.

                    GTA Hoffmann sips out of your ear, sways your hips and bypasses the vessels of your awareness, 120 times per minute. Three musicians, experienced in diverse and manifold musical areas, play their own and unique creation of live dance music.<br><br>
Beni Brachtel, aka Bartellow (guitar), Lukas Rabe (keys) and Gabriel Hahn (drums) operate their instruments as armatures of turning knobs, sliders and effect pedals and pave their way through earthy R'n'B grooves, wooden house and analogue elevator-minimalism. As improvisers and composers they love to play with shapes, moods and all types of sounds. The result is pure energy, which inspires deep listening, immersion and dancing.<br><br>
What appears to be an artificially produced electronica record is in fact the live sound of a trio, which levitates through space and time - far away from any musical categorization - while sonically complementing and reorganizing earthly pulse.<br><br>

                    Like Loonies is a Munich based band playing since 2008 in changing formations. Todays constellation existing of singer Nalan Karacagil, basist Hisashi Yamamoto, drummer Andrea Paperina, pianist Joannah Meggersee, guitarists Elias Osiander and Johannes Korsche consists since half a year. These six musicians create a sound which is coined at one hand by atmospheric piano tunes or guitarriffs, and on the other hand by stirring drumbeats, playful bass-lines which enchant the listener. Above all these instrumental waves the voice floats and makes each song to something extraordinary. You can hear some influences of Warpaint, Radiohead or similar bands, some way or other you will enjoy it.<br><br>

With over 12 years of DJing in various countries, his one of most recent activities was to run non-profit organization (more like a family with a few devoted people) KRILL, which has held many events in Tallinn and around Estonia and culminated in the great festival in summer 2011 with artists like Move D, Juju&Jordash, Oliver Hacke, Anders Ilar to name a few. Worth to mention is his residency at the annual Freerotation festival (without a doubt one of the best festivals for house and techno and electronic music in the whole wide world www.freerotation.com).<br><br>

                    Music itself is a subject that is constantly evolving from uncountable influences. In order to understand the history, emotions and structures of certain periods and their musical output, esclé decided to go on a seemingly never ending journey. Mostly based on analogue and band produced music his range varies from psychedelic rock, early electronics to jazz, disco and techno. Every set you will hear is inimitable, different in the way he plays it, different in the way you will feel it and different in the style of music you will hear.<br><br>

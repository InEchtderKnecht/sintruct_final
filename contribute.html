            <p>Hello! You might have recognized that you can click through various pictures from different artists while being on the top of the Sinstruct homepage. It does not only function to inform you about the festival, it also works as an exhibition of several artists to which everyone is invited to contribute his own work! If you have any suitable skills, we would be very happy to receive your visual interpretation of Sinstruct. This years topic is "motion".<br><br>Every work should be focused on this theme which you are invited to interpret on your own. If you send us your work please include the name of the artwork as well as your name and link to your online appearance. We cannot guarantee to use every submitted work, but we are very thankful for each contribution!<br><br>Enjoy spring!<br><br>
